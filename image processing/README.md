If you want to compile my code then you need:

2. Type in terminal "make" command its going to compile the file and make it readeble for computer
3. Then you ready to type comands deppends what you want from programm

list of comands:
./process.c HSHEX_FILE NEW_FILE VALUE - creating file for hsconvert function
./hsconvert FILENAME - converts file to image only on linux (if you have mac or windows then ... crying is only left PS i'm also crying that's fine)
